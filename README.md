# Phlow Package Publish Branch

This branch is only for publishing new packages using `phlow --publish`.

`phlow --publish` creates a fork of the `publish` branch on your github account to open a pr for the `phlow-packages` repo.

Removing this repository will not remove your package from phlow-packages.

If you want to remove a package, open an issue requesting it in [phlow-packages](https://github.com/lowcarboncode/phlow-packages/issues).
